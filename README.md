## Project :  Guess Game :

#### Overview : The game contains many categories of sports, cities and movies. First, you choose the category then start the game and then guess from the hints of the answer or get another hint, and then you will get your score and time spent.

#### As a player I should be able to do the following :

- Take some hints in case I don't know the answer.
- Knowing the correct answer in case I chose the wrong answer.
- View my final score.
- Explanation of the reasons for the deduction of my points.

- Find out how much time I spent solving the puzzle.

#### Usage :

 - type the command character for the chosen rating or exit the game.
 - After reading the rules of the game, write the chosen command, whether to start the game or choose another category.
 - Starting the puzzle and writing the selected answer letter or hint letter only, otherwise it will be counted as wrong answer.
